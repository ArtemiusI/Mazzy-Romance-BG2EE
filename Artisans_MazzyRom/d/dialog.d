~Come now, <CHARNAME>, I think we both know each other well enough to know there is no room for hesitation in either of our hearts. But as this may be the right time... there are indeed some words I must say first.~
== MAZZYJ ~Once, I believed myself prepared to face death just as I do now, but it was a fool's courage, nothing more. I considered myself having lost what mattered the most to me, and with little more to lose, I had no cause to fear death if it meant I could meet my fallen comrades once again.~
== MAZZYJ ~However... I see how different things are this time. No longer do I stand in defiance against an end, but for a chance at a new beginning... one we will not have unless we are victorious this day.~
== MAZZYJ ~Here, I fight not as a knight, not for honor or glory, but for your soul, and our future... and by Arvoreen, I shall not see it taken from us by any evil, no matter how powerful.~
== MAZZYJ ~Take the lead, <CHARNAME>, and bring me to battle. For you, I will give all that I am and ever will be, just as you have given me the greatest gift of all. Victory, and life, awaits us, my love. Let us grasp at it together.~

~The Mazzy Fentan that you first knew, had she ever believed that you desired this power for even a fraction of a second, would have sat you down and lectured you until she was confident you would never consider it again... but I am no longer that person, and she would never have been worthy of you regardless.~
= ~No, I think we both have come far, and understood the very nature of ourselves. And so, I know that how you use this power would be far more righteous than any other who might take your place... and so, for all that my love for you embodies every part of me... can I truly listen to it, and claim it is right that you abandon all of this for my sake?~
= ~I do not know. I only know that right now, we are mortal, and one day all of our past, present and future will become but memory... and perhaps, if godhood is a form of freedom from this fate, then it would be right to take it. I would not want it. But I do want to ensure your eternal happiness... yet eternity means different things for mortals and a god.~
= ~So if you believe this is the correct path, whether for yourself or for the realms... then abandon all doubt and claim it. My soul belongs always to Arvoreen... but my heart will forever be yours, and even in the realms of the divine, we may yet meet again one day.~
= ~Such are my last words of guidance to you... perhaps the last you will ever hear from me, the last you may ever need, even. But if there is yet a chance we may both walk away from here, unchanged... I will hold onto hope. Regardless of the outcome, know that you have my undying love, my <CHARNAME>.~
