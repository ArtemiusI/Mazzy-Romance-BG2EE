Mazzy Romance for BG2:EE by The Artisan
https://artisans-corner.com/mazzy-romance/

This mod adds an extensive romantic path with Mazzy, the lovely halfling knight.

Contents include 20 timer-based talks as well as a variety of event-based talks in Shadows of Amn, 8 talks in ToB, a romantic epilogue with small variations depending on your personal choices and circumstances, and the usual romance-related events.

The trigger for activating the romance, should you prove eligible (non-evil alignment) is having a reputation of 15 or above. About 45 or so minutes afterwards, Mazzy will begin talking to you.

If you decide partway through you are not interested and want to let her down easy, simply talk to her via PID (player-induced dialogue, aka forcetalking) and tell her so.

Questions & Answers

Q: What are the requirements for the romance?
A: Be non-evil and have a reputation higher than 14. There are no race or gender restrictions.

Q: How does this mod interact with IEP’s Mazzy Friendship mod?
A: You will not see dialogues from that mod if you are currently considered to be in a romance. Since several of the dialogues go over similar topics, it would be repetitive and tedious to see both in the same playthrough. Not to mention the lack of sensible continuity. If you break the romance, the friendship dialogues come up again.

Q: How does this mod interact with the All Things Mazzy mod?
A: It doesn’t. I’ve set no restrictions but don’t use them together. I’m not getting into that thing. Don’t ask me to.

Q: How mature would you consider the romance content?
A: It’s mostly tame. There’s some topics that verge on getting dark, but nothing explicit from either the psychological or sexual end.

Q: Romance conflicts?
A: I have not written any yet because I am lazy, so the romance will just turn off if another original game romance reaches the committed stage, and do the same to them vice versa. Eventually that will change. When I feel like it.

Q: Can Mazzy become a paladin with this mod?
A: No. It’s not that simple and shouldn’t be. I personally think it cheapens her character. If you’re that desperate for her to feel good about herself and/or wield Carsomyr, go check out my Divine Champion component in the kitpack for the closest thing she’ll get.

Q: Why isn’t her original quest starting?
A: If you’re on the romance path, it gets delayed until after a specific talk.

Q: She hasn’t talked to me for a while and I don’t think I’m done yet…
A: Sometimes a dialogue just doesn’t go off when it should and then the timer gets hung. Talk to her via PID and you’ll see a specific option to reset her timer to two minutes, after which she’ll talk if she is supposed to.

Q: What do I do about the vampire stuff? I missed the dialogue.
A: Take her to her family like she asked.
